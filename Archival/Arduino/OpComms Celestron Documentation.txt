HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION:

SSI OpComms owns several Celestron motorized telescope arms. They each contain two motors; one allows for azimuth
(left-right) rotation, the other altitude (up-down) rotation. While originally designed to aim telescopes, they have
been repurposed to aim a laser (attached to a telescope) and several different light-focusing devices, including a
modified telescope and a box containing a focusing Fresnel lens.

The arms each have a hand unit with buttons that allows a user to input a range of commands. Most are not useful for
the team's purposes, but they are all listed in the maps below. As of time of writing, the transmit and receive
arms have different hardware and software, and thus operate differently.

In addition, the hand units have a port that allows them to be controlled from a computer. They can be connected via
telephone handset cable to an Arduino board, which connect via USB to a computer. The computer will then be able to
communicate via Serial to the telescope, sending commands and receiving information. Arduino software has been
developed for this purpose; relevant documentation is included along with it.

=======================================================================================================================
HAND UNIT MENU NAVIGATION:

"ENTER" button goes deeper into menus
"UNDO" button goes up a level in menus
At root, hit "MENU" (Key 3) to bring up the useful menu.
Use "UP" (Key 6) and "DOWN" (Key 9) to scroll through options in a menu.

Options with (x) next to them serve no current use, but may be worthy of exploration.
They are included to give a complete diagram of all controls that a user is likely to see on screen.

Items marked with a *** (here, not actually in the menus) are particularly important for OpComms.

=======================================================================================================================
